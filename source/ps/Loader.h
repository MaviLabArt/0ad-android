Overview
--------

"Loading" is the act of preparing a game session, including reading all
required data from disk. Ideally, this would be very quick, but for complex
maps and/or low-end machines, a duration of several seconds can be expected.
Having the game freeze that long is unacceptable; instead, we want to display
the current progress and task, which greatly increases user patience.


Allowing for Display
--------------------

To display progress, we need to periodically 'interrupt' loading.
Threads come to mind, but there is a problem: since OpenGL graphics calls
must come from the main thread, loading would have to happen in a
background thread. Everything would thus need to be made thread-safe,
which is a considerable complication.

Therefore, we load from a single thread, and split the operation up into
"tasks" (as short as possible). These are typically function calls instead of
being called directly, they are registered with our queue. We are called from
the main loop and process as many tasks as possible within one "timeslice".

After that, progress is updated: an estimated duration for each task
(derived from timings on one machine) is used to calculate headway.
As long as task lengths only differ by a constant factor between machines,
this timing is exact; even if not, only smoothness of update suffers.


Interrupting Lengthy Tasks
--------------------------

The above is sufficient for basic needs, but breaks down if tasks are long
(> 500ms). To fix this, we will need to modify the tasks themselves:
either make them coroutines, i.e. have them return to the main loop and then
resume where they left off, or re-enter a limited version of the main loop.
The former requires persistent state and careful implementation,
but yields significant advantages:
- progress calculation is easy and smooth,
- all services of the main loop (especially input*) are available, and
- complexity due to reentering the main loop is avoided.

* input is important, since we want to be able to abort long loads or
even exit the game immediately.

We therefore go with the 'coroutine' (more correctly 'generator') approach.
Examples of tasks that take so long and typical implementations may
be seen in MapReader.cpp.


Intended Use
------------

  PS::Loader::BeginRegistering();
  PS::Loader::Register(..) for each sub-function
  PS::Loader::EndRegistering();
Then in the main loop, call PS::Loader::ProgressiveLoad().

void BeginRegistering();

/**

 * `co_yield ...` can be used to yield the current progress. Iff the timeout is

 * `co_await std::suspend_always{}` is usefull to force a suspention. e.g. When
 *	no progress can be made such as when the work is done on a different

 * `co_return 0` notifies the loader that the task is fineshed without an
 *	error.
 * `co_return ...` when the returned value is negative the loader interprets
 *	that as a task failure. `PS::Loader::ProgressiveLoad` will abort
