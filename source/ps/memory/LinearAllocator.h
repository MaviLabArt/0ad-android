/**
 * Linear allocator (also known as an arena allocator or bump allocator) is
 * a simple and fast system that allocates memory sequentially from a single
 * growing memory buffer. Each allocation only moves a free pointer forward.
 * Releasing all allocations happens at the Release call.
 *
 * It's not thread-safe.
 *
 * It's intendent to use for allocations with a short lifespan (f.e. function
 * scoped).
 *
 * There is std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource but it doesn't provide
 * information about the current capacity and doesn't allow to limit the
 * capacity. Also avoiding virtual calls for frequent allocations.
