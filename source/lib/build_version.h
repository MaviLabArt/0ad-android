 * The "compatible patch version" is the earliest patch version with which the
 * current version is compatible. It should ideally stay at 0 all the time.
 * If the compatible patch version is bumped:
 * - a new lobby room must be opened
 * - the version of the public '0ad' mod must be bumped
 * - incompatible replays and savegames will be rotated as new folders are created
 *
 * This does not describe compatibility with the modding API. Modders are advised
 * to rely on the actual engine version.
