EXPERIENCE AND RANKS
Soldiers gain experience while fighting or being garrisoned in their training facility.
Experience progresses them through a set of ranks, "Basic" => "Advanced" => "Elite", displayed by an icon above their healthbar.
Higher ranks increase a unit's damage and resistance, but lower its gather rates.
As they advance, they even change their visual appearance too - i.e. upgrading their equipment!
