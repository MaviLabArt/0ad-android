BATCH TRAINING
Hold down the 'Batch Production' hotkey (by default SHIFT) while left-clicking on the desired unit on the training panel.
Left-click repeatedly to add the same number of units to the batch every time.
Customize the default batch size in the game options or scroll on the mousewheel while pressing the said hotkey to temporarily adjust it during a game.
Combine with the autoqueue for maximum efficiency.
